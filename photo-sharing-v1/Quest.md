Final Project: Complete the app
In this project, you will extend your work on Lab 3 by adding the ability for users to login,
comment on photos, and upload new photos. Note that these new feature additions are full
stack in that you will need to modify both the front end (React app) and the back end (Node
web server and MongoDB database).
Problem 1: Simple Login (15 points)
Extend your photo app to have the notion of a user being logged in. If a user is logged in, the
toolbar should include a small message &quot;Hi &lt;firstname&gt;&quot; where &lt;firstname&gt; is the first name of
the logged-in user. The toolbar should also contain a button displaying &quot;Logout&quot; that will log the
user out.
If there is no user logged in, the toolbar should display &quot;Please Login&quot; and the main view of your
application should display a new view component named LoginRegister. The LoginRegister view
should provide a way for a user to login and, as part of Problem 4 below, register as a new user.
All attempts to navigate to a different view (e.g., deep links) should result in the display being
redirected to the LoginRegister view if no user is logged in. (See the hints section if you are
unsure how to implement this.) In addition, the user list on the left should not be populated if the
current user is not logged in. (See the section below about modifying the server endpoints to
return a status of 401 (Unauthorized).)
When a user logs in successfully, the view should switch to displaying the user&#39;s details. If the
user login fails (e.g., no user with the login_name) the view should report an appropriate error
message and let the user try again.
Extend your backend implementation to support the photo app&#39;s notion of logged in users. In
making this change you will need to change both the database schema and the web server API.
Extend the Mongoose schema for User to add a new property login_name. This property is a
string containing the identifier the user will type when logging in (their &quot;login name&quot;).
Modify the web server API to support 2 new REST API calls for logging a user in and out. Like
in the previous assignment we will use HTTP requests with JSON-encoded bodies to transmit
model data. The API uses POST requests to:
● /admin/login - Provides a way for the photo app&#39;s LoginRegister view to login in a user.
The POST request JSON-encoded body should include a property login_name (no
passwords for now) and reply with information needed by your app for logged in user.
An HTTP status of 400 (Bad request) should be returned if the login failed
(e.g., login_name is not a valid account). A parameter in the request body is accessed
using request.body.parameter_name. Note the login register handler should ensure that
there exists a user with the given login_name. If so, it stores some information in the
Express session (or generate a JWT token if using token-based authentication) where it
can be checked by other request handlers that need to know whether a user is logged in.

The return body of POST /admin/login should be the properties of the logged in user your
web app needs. Our tests require the _id property but you can include any other user
object properties. Returning the entire user object is discouraged because of what is
added in Problem 4.
● /admin/logout - A POST request with an empty body to this URL will logout the user by
clearing the information stored in the session (or delete the JWT token on the client if
using token-based authentication) . An HTTP status of 400 (Bad request) should be
returned in the user is not currently logged in.
As part of updating the web server to handle login/logout, you need to update all requests (except
to /admin/login and /admin/logout) to reject the request with a status of 401 (Unauthorized) if
the session state does not report a user is logged in (or does not have valid token in request
header if using token-based authentication).
Problem 2: New Comments (15 points)
Once you have implemented user login, the next step is to implement the ability to add
comments to photos. In the photo detail view where you display the comments of a photo, add
the ability for the currently logged in user to add a comment to the photo. You get to design the
user interface (e.g., popup dialog, input field, etc.) for this feature. It should be obvious how to
use it and what photo the comment is about. The display of the photo and its comments should
be updated immediately to reflect the newly added comment.
For the backend support extend the web server API with the following HTTP POST API:
● /commentsOfPhoto/:photo_id - Add a comment to the photo whose id is photo_id. The
body of the POST requests should be a JSON-encoded body with a single
property comment that contains the comment&#39;s text. The comment object created on the
photo must include the identifier of the logged in user and the time when the comment
was created. Your implementation should reject any empty comments with a status of
400 (Bad request).
Problem 3: Photo Uploading (15 points)
Allow users to add new photos. When a user is logged in, the main toolbar should have a button
labeled &quot;Add Photo&quot; that allows the current logged in user to upload a photo to the app. When a
photo is successfully posted, it should show up automatically on the user photos page, or at the
very least it should have some indication that the photo was added.
Extend the web server to support POST requests to the URL:
● /photos/new - Upload a photo for the current user. The body of the POST request should
be the file. The uploaded files should be placed in the images directory under an unique
name you generated. The unique name, along with the creation data and logged in user id,
should be placed in the new Photo object you create. A response status of 400 should be
returned if there is no file in the POST request.

Problem 4: Registration and Passwords (15 points)
Enhance the LoginRegister view component to support new-user registration and passwords.
Extend the login portion to add a password field. Add a registration section that allows all the
fields of the User object to be filled in. To reduce the chance that the user typos that password
the view should contain a an additional copy of the password field and the view should only
allow the user to be created if the two password fields are identical. Good security practice
requires that the passwords typed by the user shouldn&#39;t be visible in the view. Registration should
be triggered by a button at the bottom of the page labeled &quot;Register Me&quot;. When the button is
pushed either an error should be reported explaining specifically why it didn&#39;t work or a success
message should be reported and the register form input fields should be cleared.
For the backend, extend the User object schema with a string field password that will store the
password.
Extend the web server to support POST requests to the URL:
● /user - Allows a user to register. The registration POST takes a JSON-encoded body with
the following properties: (login_name, password, first_name, last_name, location,
description, occupation). The post request handler must make sure that the
new login_name is specified and doesn&#39;t already exist. The first_name, last_name,
and password must be non-empty strings as well (the other fields may be empty). If the
information is valid, then a new user is created in the database. The response body should
be the properties your web app needs. Our tests require the login_name property be
present. If there is an error, the response should return status 400 and a string indicating
the error.
Enhance the LoginRegister view to support logging in with a password and check it as part of the
post request to /admin/login.
